# Data Structures in C++
This repository contains a bunch of data structures implemented in C++. Like everyone who has ever implemented data structures, I started this for educational purposes, but things escalated and now I revisit them and increment them with new functionality as needed.

I also use them in [other projects](https://www.github.com/douglasrizzo/search) of mine.
